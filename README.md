# DOOM-Eternal-At-Home

Welcome to DEAH: a 2D-DoomEternal-2Player Java Game! This project is a visually stunning 2D game inspired by Doom Eternal, where one player controls Doom Guy and the other plays as the Baron of Hell. Engage in intense battles within a confined area, filled with wooden and unbreakable boxes forming the map. Break boxes to collect loot, improve your stats, and gain health.

## Game Features

- **Player Characters:** Take control of Doom Guy or the Baron of Hell, each with unique abilities and playstyles. Engage in head-to-head battles in a close-quarters environment.

- **Box Breakage and Loot:** Break wooden boxes scattered across the map to uncover valuable loot. Loot can enhance your stats, including bullet count, armor, damage, and fire rate. Collect health to maintain your vitality.
